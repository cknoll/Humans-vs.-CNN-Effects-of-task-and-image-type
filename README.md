# Supplementary data for "Humans-vs.-CNN-Effects-of-task-and-image-type"


## Summary

Do humans and CNN attend to similar areas during scene classification? And how does this depend on the task used to elicit human attention maps? These questions were addressed in an article (link added soon) that compared attention maps generated from human eye movements, human manual selection, or so called e**x**plainable **a**rtificial **i**ntelligence (XAI). The present repository contains the respective source code (added soon):

- the CNN architecture (ResNet-152),
- the XAI method (Grad-CAM), and
- the procedure for extracting attention maps from humans and CNN.
